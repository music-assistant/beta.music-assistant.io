# LastFM Scrobbler ![Preview image](../assets/icons/audioscrobbler-icon.svg){ width=126 align=right }

Music Assistant has the ability to [scrobble](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/scrobble) to [LastFM](https://www.last.fm/) or [LibreFM](https://libre.fm/). Contributed and maintained by [Willem-Jan Zijderveld](https://github.com/wjzijderveld)

## Features

- Connect to either LastFM or LibreFM and scrobble the songs that are playing
- Now playing feature is supported

## Configuration

- First obtain the API credentials. For LastFM follow the first two steps from [here](https://www.last.fm/api/authentication)
- Enter your credentials and click `Authorize with LastFM`, this will open a new tab with LastFM where permission must be given by clicking "Yes, allow access"
- The UI will indicate a successful login. Ensure to click SAVE to complete the configuration

## Known Issues / Notes

- Currently songs will only get scrobbled when they're fully played (90+%)
- Be careful to avoid double scrobbling. This is possible if a music provider is used that also does scrobbling internally. A future improvement is to make it configurable which music providers will be scrobbled
