## Known Issues / Notes

The full functionality is enabled when you are a UK-based listener, and signed in to your BBC account. The BBC has slowly been moving towards excluding non-UK listeners from using its Sounds platform, more details [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/help/questions/listening-outside-the-uk/outside-uk-changes). This provider currently allows access to live and catch up radio to International listeners via the Sounds API, but this could be restricted in the future.

## Not Yet Supported

- Pausing and seeking live radio
- The international menu should show avaiable podcasts, this will be supported in a future release, but is not currently
- Showing the currently playing song on catch-up
- For signed-in users, accessing your subscribed content through the library is not yet supported, but is planned
