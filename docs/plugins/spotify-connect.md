Music Assistant has the ability to add [Spotify Connect](https://connect.spotify.com/) support to any MA player.

## Features

- Any MA player can be exposed including groups

## Known Issues / Notes

- To use Spotify Connect, all devices must be connected to the same network. Refer to the [Spotify Connect Support Article](https://support.spotify.com/en/article/spotify-connect/) for more information
- If the device does not natively support announcements then playback will be interrupted if an announcement is sent to a player that is being streamed to via Spotify Connect. Currently this means that, announcements will only work on the Voice PE devices (and derivatives) and Sonos S2 devices
- The MA volume normalization functionality is only available in dynamic mode
