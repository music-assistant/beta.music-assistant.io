# Home Assistant Integration

The Music Assistant integration for Home Assistant provides a connection from MA to HA. This means that MA players are visible in HA and can be controlled via the HA UI or via automations or scripts.

- [Announcements](announcements.md) from HA in the form of Text to Speech or audio files are fully supported.

- With some additional setup voice control of MA via HA is also possible.

- The integration can connect to the MA server which is running either as an HA addon or as a docker container on the same or another host system.

- The integration is an official part of Home Assistant, no need to install custom components.

Note that there also is a [Home Assistant provider](player-support/ha.md) within MA itself, this functions the other way around: It lets you use Home Assistant functionality (and players) in Music Assistant !
